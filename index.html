    <a href="https://youtu.be/F2GOk5Rifjg">EXPAND</a> 2019<br>
During the Expand artistic residency at the headquarters of the association Espaço do Tempo, Montemor, an interactive installation based on SonarX real-time image sonification software, designed by me with colleague Francisco Medeiros, was designed and displayed.

 <p><a href="https://www.largoresidencias.com/projectos/sou-lxpoeta">NEXTSTOP/LXPOETA</a> 2019<br>
   This interactive video installation was created as a mean to display videos in an interactive way. Ultrasonic distance sensors and infrared presence sensors activates videos of contents related to the host event.
   The system runs as a stand-alon piece (Raspberry Pi with an Arduino) without requiring any further instruction. 
  </p>
<p><a href="https://reframe.sussex.ac.uk/reframebooks/archive2016/live-interfaces/">SYNESTHEATRE</a> 2016<br>
As a presentation of the device developed by the Department of Synesthesia, University of Sussex, an installation was created that allowed users to try it out and verify its usefulness in identifying colored objects in space.
</p>    
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/FTXHnIfcT48">CATRAIA TOTEM</a> 2019<br>
Project presented at the Catraia Festival, Praia da Tocha, Aveiro. A structure of recycled materials, collected during a beach cleaning action, supports a system of 6 distance sensors connected by Arduino that control a lighting system of a 5m strip of LEDs.
</p>
  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/yKYWetpLBL0">ONYRICUM</a> 2015<br>
At the “Festival della Creativitá” in Rimini, Italy, 2015 an installation was created with two Onyricum systems. This system places the users' images in virtual scenarios with a delay corresponding to the time of the journey between the image capture location and the display location.<br>

This work is a project in continuous development as a multimedia support system for Poetry Slam events. It consists of a display generated by the Raspberry Pi with Pure Data and controlled via browser, with several functions, among which to capture the noise of the public and convert it into a score from 0 to 10.</p>
